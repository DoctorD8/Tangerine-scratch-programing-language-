# Tangerine-scratch-programing-language-
This project is a programing language made on scratch called tangerine where here is where I will put downloads and notes on how to use the language which will include examples of simmilar actions to the actions in the language.
The project is in no need of collaborations but this is rather being posted for a collection of projects being kept and show my progress to the world.
Version 1.0.0 is done (im going on how gamejolt does its versions which is major.small.bugs) and the version can easily program simple things like choose your own adventure games but sadly not any math yet which will be added soon.
Well thank you for your time
